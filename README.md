# ManufacturingOOT
This is a final project in learning Software Engineering with Object Oriented Technique

## How to use
This project created with Netbeans and without maven support. For somewhat reason I think without maven is more convenience for some of my friends. This our group's final task.

1. Download project as ZIP or clone
2. Open in Netbeans
3. Right click project > Properties
4. Click Libraries from Categories
5. Click Add Library from the right side of the window
6. Choose EclipseLink and MySQL JDBC Driver

8. Edit file as needed

## Last words
Well, some of you maybe face some errors. Don't give up. Good luck have fun.
